 * Hide elements from all users.

 * This now uses Tailwind's hidden utility which supports responsive modifiers.
 * Used for elements which should not be immediately displayed to any user. An
 * example would be collapsible details that will be expanded with a click
 * from a user. The effect of this class can be toggled with the jQuery show()
 * and hide() functions.
 * 
 * NOTE: .hidden class is provided by Tailwind CSS and supports responsive
 * modifiers like md:hidden, lg:block, etc.
